Directions: When the user has started the application a login screen will display showing them a User ID and Pass
Word textfields. The form will be translated between French and English depending on the user's language settings.
Once the user has entered valid credentials, they will be directed into the main screen. This screen will allow 
the user to choose between customers, contacts and reports. When the user clicks on the Customers button, they will
be directed to the Customer screen where they can create new customers and appointments for those customers. To add
a customer, the user will click on the add button just below the customer table where they will be directed to a 
different screen to collect information about that customer. The same thing will happen for the edit customer button.
You will also be able to delete any customer which will also delete any appointments attached to that customer. In
the appointments table you will be able to add, update and delete appoinments as well. You will also have a choice
of displaying the appointments for the coming week or month. On the main screen the user will also have the option
to view the current contacts that are in the orginzation as well as going to the reports screen. In the reports
screen, you will be able to find out how many reports are in a given month of a certain type by selecting choices
in combo boxes as well as viewing all of the appointments that a contact has had. For further explanation please
check out the javadocs created for the application.

Additional Report: For my additional report I have chose the ability to see what appointments any given customer
has scheduled by clicking on that customer in the customer table. I believe this is a useful function as you will
need to select a customer in order to delete it from the application and this will display all of the appointments
that you will be deleting with that customer. The user will be able to check and verify that there were no importan
appointments that will still need to be taken care of before they delete them entirely.
